# Hello!
My name is Piotr Lach. You can learn more about me below.
## Education
My alma mater is University of Białystok, Poland. I hold a bachelor’s and master’s degree in computer science and English philology. I finished my studies with very good grades.
## Abilities
Thanks to English philology I’ve got a fluent command of English, both in verbal and written form. During my computer science studies I’ve learned about various types of software; I intensely practiced designing and coding algorithms.

I like programming in Java the most. With its help, I completed many tasks assigned by my teachers. Implementing chess was particularly instructive; it solidified my skills related to object-oriented programming and design patterns, among others. The application is available in my [Chess](https://github.com/PiotrLach/Chess) repository.
## My strengths
I put great emphasis on the readability and reliability of the code I write. In that, I try to:
* use meaningful names,
* split the program into concise functions, arranged in a general-to-specific order;
* avoid duplication 
* avoid nesting code too much,
* apply proper levels of encapsulation,
* organize code in conceptually cohesive files,
* make my git commits consistent.

I program with passion. I’m not discouraged by problems. I don’t implement solutions, which I haven’t thought through.
